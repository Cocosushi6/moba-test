# moba-test

A project in C++, whose goal is to try and implement basic moba/rts game system, with enemies, monsters, secondary quests, 3D world with different layers and altitudes, class system, and basic building system. 

Libraries used (and soon in use) :
 - SFML (especially the networking part, most of rendering is done with pure OpenGL)
 - SFGUI, a GUI library for SFML
 - pugixml to parse .tmx files created with Tiled editor (will be used to convert xml data into game Tile classes)
